# FoundRy Repo Creator

Create a governed child repository package from an AI capability, prompt artifact, research concept, or product idea.

## Trigger When

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- migrate a Custom GPT, Gem, Copilot agent, or prompt bundle into GitHub
- create a new FoundRy child repository
- standardize a repository against FoundRy governance
- convert a platform-specific AI artifact into a reusable capability package
- generate scaffold files for `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `manifest.yaml`, `docs/`, `origin/`, `skill/`, `research/`, `tests/`, `schemas/`, `assets/`, `exports/`, and `archive/`

## Required Output

Produce a repo package containing:

```text
AGENTS.md
README.md
CHANGELOG.md
LICENSE.md
manifest.yaml
docs/
origin/
skill/
prompts/
research/
tests/
schemas/
assets/
exports/
archive/
```

## Process

1. Identify the parent FoundRy.
2. Select the correct naming pattern.
3. Preserve original platform artifacts in `origin/`.
4. Convert refined deployable behavior into `skill/`.
5. Put rationale and architecture in `docs/` and `research/`.
6. Generate `manifest.yaml` from the repo manifest schema.
7. Add the repo to the FoundRy registry.
8. Flag private, client, employer, or public-source-only constraints.

## Parent FoundRy Decision

- Use `OverKill-Hill-FoundRy` for systems, promptcraft, research, writing, local AI, apps, Mermaid, and FoundRy prototypes.
- Use `AskJamie-FoundRy` for AskJamie, BrandGuard, Enterprise Sleuth, RAG, identity, and conversation behavior.
- Use `Glee-fullyTools-FoundRy` for Glee-fully Tools, Tool-ettes, consumer utilities, tone systems, and life/productivity tools.

## Graduation Gate

Do not mark a repository as public-ready until PII, employer references, licensed material, source rights, and manifest visibility fields have been reviewed.
