# Routing Anchors Contract

This reference defines the anchor roles required by `okhp3-notion-capture-router`.

Do not commit real private Notion URLs, database IDs, collection IDs, or connector-only resource IDs into this public repository.

At runtime, the agent should receive a private anchor map from the user's prompt, project files, connector context, or a non-committed file named:

```text
routing-anchors.private.md
```

## Required anchor roles

| Anchor role | Purpose | Required use |
|---|---|---|
| Brain hub | User intent, system doctrine, top-level knowledge architecture | Read first for operating context |
| Intake page | Front door for raw, unsorted incoming AI threads | Use only when no better route is known |
| Chat Threads database | Thread-level source record | Dedupe and create or update one row per source thread |
| Extracts database | Nugget-level durable knowledge | Create or update one row per reusable idea |
| Domains database | Routing authority | Match by rules, boundaries, routing notes, hub URL, and parent domain |
| Projects database | Active project relation | Attach thread and extracts when a specific project exists |
| Notion to GitHub routing hub | Repo to Notion anchor index | Resolve the matching OKHP3 repo and its canonical Notion anchor |
| Master Page Index | Physical and public-surface page index | Confirm structural root, visibility, and surface role |
| Relationship Mindmap | High-level map of domain tree and existing captures | Use for orientation and routing sanity checks |

## Private anchor map shape

A private map may use this shape:

```md
# routing-anchors.private.md

- Brain hub: [private Notion page URL]
- Intake page: [private Notion page URL]
- Chat Threads database: [private Notion database or data source URL]
- Extracts database: [private Notion database or data source URL]
- Domains database: [private Notion database or data source URL]
- Projects database: [private Notion database or data source URL]
- Notion to GitHub routing hub: [private Notion page URL]
