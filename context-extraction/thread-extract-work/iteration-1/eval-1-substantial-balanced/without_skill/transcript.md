# Execution transcript

## Resources consulted

- Baseline `SKILL.md` from the isolated pre-update snapshot.
- Baseline `references/extraction-contract.md`.
- Baseline `references/extraction-depth-profiles.md`.
- Baseline `references/platform-capture-patterns.md`.
- Baseline `assets/thread-extract-template.md`.
- Baseline `scripts/create_thread_extract.py`.
- Evaluation fixture `mixed-balanced-thread.md`.

The current repository skill was not read. No source platform, external URL, PDF, Canvas, or other sidecar was accessed.

## Choices

- Normalized the explicit `substantial` request to `balanced`.
- Recorded source platform as `unknown`, capture mode as `full-paste`, and completeness as `partial`.
- Treated the four explicitly labeled `You` and `Assistant` blocks as four high-confidence turns.
- Cataloged the described image, unavailable PDF, title-only Canvas, and grouped UI controls; excluded UI chrome from semantic content.
- Used `needs-review` because the referenced privacy-rules PDF was not supplied.
- Derived the primary topic `Repository-independent AI thread extraction with missing asset controls` and the artifact title `Repository-Independent AI Thread Extraction with Missing Asset Controls`.
- Drafted inside the requested run directory and reserved the `outputs` child for the writer-generated artifact.

## Script result

- The baseline bundled `create_thread_extract.py` completed successfully using the installed Python 3.12 runtime.
- It normalized `substantial` to `balanced` and generated `outputs/repo-independent-thread-extract-missing-assets.md`.
- After rereading the generated file, speaker labels were moved exclusively to turn-boundary evidence, the five-element ledger was renumbered, and the previously generated artifact was deliberately replaced with `--allow-existing`.
- Final verification confirmed the title chain, metadata, partial provenance, `needs-review` retention decision, required headings, missing-asset treatment, and standalone continuation guidance.

## Errors

- The initial read-only destination inspection reported that the `without_skill` directory did not yet exist. No files were changed by that check; the run directory was then created through the draft patch.
- `python3` and `python` resolved to unavailable Microsoft Store aliases. The writer was then run successfully with the installed Python 3.12 executable discovered through the local runtime inventory.
