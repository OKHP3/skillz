description: "Author and validate a Process Narrative Specification (PNS) from a PIR and stakeholder register. Use this skill when you have a completed Process Intake Record from okhp3-process-intake-and-scope and need to produce a structured narrative document that anchors ISO 9001 §4.4.1 process-box semantics, BABOK Core Concept Model, RACI matrix, SIPOC table, business rules, decision points, KPIs, and controls. Do not use it when only a quick diagram is needed without governance structure — go directly to okhp3-visual-process-modeling for that. The PNS is the authoritative handoff input for okhp3-visual-process-modeling, okhp3-sop-work-instructions, okhp3-raci-governance-matrix, and okhp3-sipoc-generation."
license: "MIT"
compatibility: "Drafting and reviewing the narrative needs no special runtime. scripts/validate-pns.mjs and scripts/score-pns-quality.mjs need a JavaScript runtime that executes ES modules (Node.js); no minimum version is pinned in this repository. If they cannot run, check the V1–V7 rules and the weighted score by hand against references/pns-schema.md and say so in your output rather than presenting the PNS as machine-validated."

# okhp3-process-narrative-authoring

## Purpose

Transform a validated PIR and stakeholder register into a Process Narrative Specification (PNS): the structured document that anchors process semantics for human review and downstream diagram generation.

The PNS is the single source of truth between process discovery and visual modeling. It documents what the process does, who does it, how it is governed, how it is measured, and what can go wrong.

---

## When to use this skill

- PIR has `completeness_score ≥ 70` and `ready_for_narrative: true`
- User needs a formal process document (ISO 9001 §4.4.1, BABOK §7)
- You need to produce SIPOC, RACI, or business rules as standalone artifacts
- Preparing input for `okhp3-visual-process-modeling`

## When NOT to use this skill

- PIR has not been validated: complete `okhp3-process-intake-and-scope` first
- User only needs a quick diagram without governance structure: go directly to `okhp3-visual-process-modeling`
- Process is exploratory and roles/rules are completely unknown: return to `okhp3-process-intake-and-scope`

---

## PNS Structure — 13 Required Sections

### 1. process_box (ISO 9001 §4.4.1)

`trigger`, `inputs[]` (each with `name`, `source`), `outputs[]` (each with `name`, `consumer`), `criteria`, `resources`, `responsibilities`, `risks`.

### 2. activity_sequence

Ordered activities. Each: `id`, `description` (single imperative per IEEE 29148), `actor_role_id`, `inputs[]`, `outputs[]`, `systems[]`, `preconditions`, `postconditions`.

Minimum 3 activities for full quality score.

### 3. roles_and_raci

**roles[]:** `{ role_id, role_name }`. **raci_matrix[]:** one per activity: `activity_id`, `responsible[]` (≥1), `accountable` (exactly 1), `consulted[]`, `informed[]`.

### 4. business_rules

`{ id, description, source, applies_to, rationale }`. `source` is mandatory. `applies_to` references an `activity_id` or `"all"`.

### 5. decision_points

`{ id, description, activity_id, criteria, outcomes[] }`. Each entry must have ≥2 outcomes. Each outcome: `{ label, next_activity }`.

### 6. exception_paths

`{ id, description, trigger, handling, owner_role_id, escalation_path }`. `handling` is mandatory and non-empty.

### 7. kpis

`{ id, name, formula, data_source, target, frequency }`. Both `formula` and `data_source` are mandatory.

### 8. systems_and_integrations

`{ system_name, role, integration_type, activities_supported[] }`.

### 9. controls_and_compliance

`{ id, type, description, standard_ref, activities_covered[], waiver }`. Empty triggers a V7 warning.

### 10. open_questions

`{ id, question, owner_role_id, target_resolution_date }`. Record gaps: do not invent content.

### 11. babok_core_concepts

Minimum 4 of 6 fields populated (≥20 chars each): `change`, `need`, `solution`, `stakeholders`, `value`, `context`.

### 12. revision_history

`{ version, date, author_role, summary }`. Required for document change traceability.

### 13. validation (computed)

`{ pns_quality_score, ready_for_publication, ready_for_bpmn_modeling }`. Populated by `scripts/score-pns-quality.mjs`. Do not author manually.

## V1–V7 Validation Rules

| Rule | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | error | Required top-level fields present; status valid; ≥4 babok_core_concepts; all 13 section keys present |
| V2 | error | Every activity has non-empty description + actor_role_id; every business rule has non-empty source |
| V3 | error | Every RACI entry has exactly one Accountable and at least one Responsible; every activity has a RACI entry |
| V4 | warning | Activity descriptions containing semicolons, >200 chars, or starting with subordinate conjunctions |
| V5 | error | Every KPI must have non-empty formula and data_source |
| V6 | error | Every decision_point must have ≥2 outcomes; every exception_path must have non-empty handling |
| V7 | warning | controls_and_compliance is empty; activities not covered by any control |

Run: `node scripts/validate-pns.mjs <pns.yaml>`

## Authoring Workflow

Execute in order:
1. Load PIR: read `pir.yaml` and `stakeholder-register.yaml`
2. Map inputs: PIR actors → roles, steps → activities, rules → business_rules
3. Draft process_box: trigger, inputs, outputs, criteria, responsibilities, risks
4. Expand activities: enrich each step with preconditions, postconditions, system assignments
5. Build RACI: assign R/A/C/I for each activity from PIR actor types
6. Document rules and decisions: expand business_rules with source citations; derive decision points
7. Define KPIs: at least one KPI with formula and data_source per core process objective
8. Add controls: map applicable compliance standards to activities
9. Anchor CCM: populate all 6 babok_core_concepts fields
10. Record open questions: do not invent content
11. Validate: run `scripts/validate-pns.mjs`; fix all errors before continuing
12. Score: run `scripts/score-pns-quality.mjs`; ensure score ≥75 before handoff

---

## Handoff Instruction

When validation passes and score ≥ 75, pass `pns.yaml` to:
- `okhp3-visual-process-modeling`: for BPMN diagram generation
- `okhp3-sop-work-instructions`: for SOP documents
- `okhp3-raci-governance-matrix`: for standalone RACI matrix
- `okhp3-sipoc-generation`: for SIPOC table

---

## Execution contract

Apply this contract on every run so the artifact is trustworthy and reusable:

1. State the input evidence, assumptions, and unresolved questions before drafting. Never invent missing process facts, owners, controls, dates, or approvals.
2. Preserve stable identifiers and source traceability. When transforming an upstream artifact, retain its IDs and cite the source field or section for each derived decision.
3. Produce the declared artifact exactly, including required fields and valid values. Keep unsupported, uncertain, or not-applicable items explicit instead of silently omitting them.
4. Validate the result with the bundled script or fixture when available. Report validation status, warnings, and any manual review still required.
5. Stop and request the missing input when a boundary, approval authority, or safety-critical rule cannot be inferred. A partial artifact with clearly marked open questions is safer than a confident fabrication.

If `scripts/validate-pns.mjs` or `scripts/score-pns-quality.mjs` cannot run, apply the V1–V7 table and the weighted-score table by hand using `references/pns-schema.md`, and state in the output that automated validation or scoring was not run.

## References

Load on demand:
- `references/pns-schema.md`: complete field-level documentation for all 13 sections, 9-state PNS lifecycle, and traceability rules

## Scripts

- `scripts/validate-pns.mjs`: V1–V7 validation
- `scripts/score-pns-quality.mjs`: weighted quality score

## Assets

- `assets/fixtures/pns-example.yaml`: canonical PNS fixture for purchase-approval process

## Evaluation and release status

Three root-level `evals/` categories target this skill's validator, `validatePns()`: `control-coverage` (weight tied to controls_and_compliance coverage), `narrative-completeness` (all-13-sections and not-applicable-with-rationale handling), and `role-consistency` (RACI role-dictionary alignment). **All three currently point `manifest.json`'s `validator_module` at `skills/okhp3-process-narrative/scripts/validate-pns.mjs`, a path that does not exist in this repository.** The real module is `skills/okhp3-process-narrative-authoring/scripts/validate-pns.mjs`. Verified by static path inspection in this session, not by a live run; `node scripts/run-eval-suite.mjs` would currently fail to load all three categories with `Module not found`. Fixing the `validator_module` string in each of those three `manifest.json` files is outside this task's scope (repo-root `evals/`, not `skills/*/SKILL.md`) but is the single highest-leverage follow-up for this skill, given it is the dependency hub every downstream skill relies on — flagged here rather than silently left implied as working.

No dedicated `evals/evals.json` exists in this skill's own package. Evidence status: `not-run` (live) / `analytical` (the path-break above, verified statically) for task quality and skill uplift.

Version 0.2.0 (this pass) added the `compatibility` declaration, per-script fallback instructions, and a sharper discovery-time boundary against `okhp3-visual-process-modeling` for quick-diagram requests. Classified minor per the versioning table, not patch. No live regression run backs this bump; that limitation is disclosed, not implied away.
