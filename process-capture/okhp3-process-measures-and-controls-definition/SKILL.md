description: Define process performance measures, KPIs, and compliance controls for a validated PNS. Use this skill when the user needs to add measurability and governance to a documented process; when they ask to define KPIs, set performance targets, add compliance controls, or map the process to a control framework. This is a recommended extension skill — use after process-narrative-authoring when governance and measurement rigour is required. Produces a measures register and a controls register.

## Purpose

Define measurable process KPIs and structured compliance controls, enriching the PNS with the governance layer required for ISO 9001 §9.1 monitoring and COSO-aligned internal controls.

---

## When to use this skill

- PNS quality score ≥ 75 and user needs additional governance structure
- User needs to map process activities to a control framework
- Preparing process documentation for audit or certification
- PNS `kpis[]` or `controls_and_compliance[]` sections are sparse and need enrichment

## When NOT to use this skill

- PNS does not exist or is below quality threshold — complete `process-narrative-authoring` first
- User only needs basic KPIs — use the KPI authoring in `process-narrative-authoring` directly
- Do not invent performance targets without user confirmation — record as `target: TBD` with an open question

## Measures Register Design

### KPI categories

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Cycle time | Average time from trigger to completion |
| Quality | Error rate, rework rate, exception rate |
| Volume | Transactions per period |
| Compliance | % of steps completed with required controls |
| Cost | Cost per transaction |
| Customer | Satisfaction score, response time |

### KPI schema

Each KPI in `measures-register.yaml`:
- `kpi_id` — stable identifier (kpi-001, kpi-002, …)
- `name` — human-readable label
- `category` — from taxonomy above
- `formula` — calculation description (mandatory)
- `data_source` — system or record that provides the data (mandatory)
- `target` — numeric target or `"TBD"`
- `frequency` — measurement frequency (daily | weekly | monthly | quarterly)
- `owner_role_id` — from PNS `roles_and_raci.roles[]`
- `activities_measured[]` — list of `act-NNN` IDs this KPI covers

## Controls Register Design

### Control types (COSO-aligned)

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `preventive` | Stops an error from occurring |
| `detective` | Identifies an error after it occurs |
| `corrective` | Fixes an error once detected |
| `directive` | Guides behaviour through policy or procedure |

### Control schema

Each control in `controls-register.yaml`:
- `control_id` — stable identifier (ctrl-001, ctrl-002, …)
- `type` — from COSO taxonomy above
- `description` — what the control does
- `standard_ref` — the policy, regulation, or framework reference
- `activities_covered[]` — list of `act-NNN` IDs this control applies to
- `frequency` — when the control is applied
- `evidence_required` — what evidence demonstrates the control operated
- `owner_role_id` — from PNS `roles_and_raci.roles[]`

## Handoff Instruction

Merge `measures-register.yaml` KPI entries back into `pns.yaml` `kpis[]` section. Merge `controls-register.yaml` entries into `pns.yaml` `controls_and_compliance[]`. Re-run `process-validation-and-quality-scoring` to verify score improves.
